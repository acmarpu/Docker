### Docker:-

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs 
to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, 
you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, 
which means, using Docker you can build container images, 
run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as 
dockerhub Quay.io so on 


## Docker Daemon: 
- A persistent background process that manages Docker images, containers, networks, 
and storage volumes. The Docker daemon constantly listens for Docker API requests and processes them.
- The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, 
and distributing your Docker containers.

is a process that you are going to install 
Docker daemon ensure to create your requirments 

The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, 
containers, networks, and volumes, A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker serices


## Docker Client :
CLI commands
the docker  client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. 
When you use commankds such as docker run, the client sens these commands to dockerd, whcih carries them out.
the docker command uses the docker API the docker client can communicate with more than one daemon 

docker container run <image> execute process:
- docker clinet will request the daemon
- daemon will check for the image in the local registry 
- if not found in the local registry, then the image is download from default registry to local registry (pull)
- using the image in the local registry, a container is created

## how to create Docker image:-
- Converting existing containers into images
- Exporting VMS to Docker images
- Creating Docker Image using Dockerfile(instruction based Approach) 

## Docker image:-
- A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. 
Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. 
Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. 
An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.
light waight images 
dont have full OS they use the resource form your Operating system which they are running 
- An images is a read-only template with instructions for creating a docker container.

## Container:- 
- Container is an isolated area which has every thing to run the application
Container have a minimal operating system they will have base image
- container has a package or its a bundle which is cobnation of application  
and application libreys and system dependies 

## Docker tags: -
Docker tags are just an alias for an image ID. 
The tag's name must be an ASCII character string and may include lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, 
underscores, periods, and dashes.

## Docker Registries :
- A docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is public registry that anyone can use and docker is 
configured to look for images on docker hub by default. ypu can even run your own private registry.
When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, that required images are pulled from your configured 
registry. when you use the docker push command your image is pushed to your confiured registry

## Docker file :
- is a set of instructions 
- Dockerfile is file where ypu provide the steps to build your Docker images


## Docker States:
- Running (Started)
- Exited (Stopped)
- Paused 

## Docker Continer Creation Modes
- Attached Modes 
  Our terminal will recive output from container
- Detached Mode (background)
  Container runs in the background an you will recive container id
- Interactive Terminal
  Create a container and login into interactive shell
  
## Image Layers
- Image Layers read-only 
- Docker image is collections of docker images layers 
- if your layer in use, docker is not deleteing its untaging
- individule layers can be reused 
- each layer one ID
- which are any changes on top Thin layer layer 
- Thin layer layer will have data only container is present
- once you terminate container Thin layer also will be teriminate

## Docker Storage Drivers
- Ideally, very little data is written to a container's writable layer, and you use Docker volumes to write data. However, some workloads require you to be able to write to the container's writable layer. This is where storage drivers come in.
- Storage Drivers allow you to create the data in the writeble layer of the container
- volum to work need a storage driver
- to make docker volumes work we would required a storage drivers
- most used drivers aufs and overlay


## Docker volumes
- Volume adds persistent to the docker container
- Disk sharing acros containers and also between container and host
- volume life cycle is diffrent from container life cycle
- Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers

# Stateless Application
- Application which do not store any state and rely on other applicactionto store preserve the data
- stateless applications do not save users data. There is no stored knowledge or information 
 for reference to past records. Alternatively, data is stored on the back-end database or 
 into the caches of users that makes the request.

# Stateful Application
- Application which store the data/state locally and for these application the data has to 
  preserved by us using volumes
-Stateful applications maintain a userâ€™s data or relevant information 
  from one session for the use of the next session. It reads, stores, and can at least remember 
  some information each time it runs.


## Bind mount volumes
- your docker host has a folder /app you want the same folder in the container
- When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container

## tmpfs mounts
If you're running Docker on Linux, you have a third option: tmpfs mounts. When you create a container with a tmpfs mount, the container can create files outside the container's writable layer.

As opposed to volumes and bind mounts, a tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persisted in the host memory. When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won't be persisted. 



Distroless :


Bind Mounts : allows you to bind a directory in side your container 
              it will bind a folder on your container with a folder on the Host

volomes : volus also do same kind of solutions and offer you a better life cycle
           


Docker Networking :
Networking allows you comminicate containers each other and Host

Bridge Networking : default networking 

Host Networking : Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.

Overlay Network : verlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.
                  create common networks
